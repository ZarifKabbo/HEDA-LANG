        <h1>HEDA Interpreter Documentation</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The HEDA Interpreter is a simple stack-based programming language. It operates on a memory stack where each cell can hold a value. This documentation explains the core concepts, commands, and usage of the HEDA language.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
            <p>The HEDA language is built around a memory stack of 100 cells, each initially set to 0. A pointer starts at the first cell and can move left or right, modifying the value in the current cell. The commands manipulate the value at the pointer or move the pointer to another position in the stack.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Commands</h2>
            <p>The HEDA language uses four core commands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>h</strong>: Increments the value in the current cell by 1.</li>
                <li><strong>e</strong>: Decrements the value in the current cell by 1.</li>
                <li><strong>d</strong>: Moves the pointer one cell to the right.</li>
                <li><strong>a</strong>: Moves the pointer one cell to the left.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These commands allow you to navigate and manipulate the memory stack effectively.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Memory and Pointer Behavior</h2>
            <p>The memory stack is circular, meaning if the pointer moves beyond the last cell, it wraps around to the first cell. Similarly, if the pointer moves left from the first cell, it wraps around to the last cell. Values in the cells are also capped within the range of 0 to 100. If a value exceeds 100, it wraps back to 0, and if it goes below 0, it wraps back to 100.</p>

            <h2>Interpreting Code</h2>
            <p>To run a program in the HEDA Interpreter:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Enter your HEDA code into the <strong>textarea</strong>.</li>
                <li>Click the <strong>Run</strong> button to execute the code.</li>
                <li>The output, represented by corresponding characters based on the values in the stack, will be displayed in the <strong>result</strong> section.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The output is generated by mapping the values in the memory stack to a predefined set of characters, which include letters, numbers, and symbols.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Error Handling</h2>
            <p>The HEDA Interpreter includes basic error handling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Syntax Errors</strong>: Occur if the input contains characters outside of the recognized commands ('h', 'e', 'd', 'a').</li>
                <li><strong>Reference Errors</strong>: Occur if any of the recognized commands are in uppercase; the interpreter expects all commands to be lowercase.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The HEDA Interpreter provides a minimalist environment to experiment with stack-based operations and memory manipulation. Its simplicity makes it a great tool for learning the basics of stack-based programming languages.</p>
